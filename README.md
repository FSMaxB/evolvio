# Evolvio

This is evolv.io by carykh (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLnv8QaEDL0), but modified so it can be built and run using maven.

The maven build should allow this to be developed in an IDE.

My intention is to refactor this into a state in which one can work with it.

## Build
`mvn package`

## Run
`mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass=io.evolvio.Evolvio`

## Run tests
